# Design Selection Feature - Sales Pipeline Integration

## Overview

This feature automatically updates the sales pipeline when a customer selects a design in the Add Customer modal. When "Design Selected" is checked, the system automatically moves the corresponding sales opportunity to the "Closed Won" stage and updates the revenue tracking.

## How It Works

### 1. Add Customer Modal
- When adding a new customer, users can specify product interests with revenue opportunities
- For each product interest, there's a "Design Selected?" checkbox
- When this checkbox is checked:
  - The sales pipeline opportunity is automatically updated to "Closed Won" stage
  - Probability is set to 100%
  - Revenue is marked as won in the pipeline
  - A notification appears confirming the action

### 2. Sales Pipeline Integration
- Opportunities created from customer interests are automatically generated
- When "Design Selected" is checked, the pipeline stage changes from "Lead" to "Closed Won"
- The revenue amount is preserved and displayed in the pipeline
- Won deals are highlighted with green styling and celebration emoji

### 3. Visual Feedback
- Green notification appears when design is selected
- Pipeline opportunities show "ðŸŽ‰ Closed Won" badge
- Won deals are highlighted in green in the pipeline view
- Revenue amounts are emphasized for won deals

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes
- `AddCustomerModal.tsx`: Added design selection detection and pipeline updates
- `pipeline/page.tsx`: Enhanced display of closed won deals with special styling
- Added notification system for design selection events

### Backend Support
- Sales pipeline model already supports "closed_won" stage
- API endpoints handle stage transitions properly
- Revenue tracking works seamlessly

## User Workflow
