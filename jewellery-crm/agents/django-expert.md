## COMMON PATTERNS

### ViewSet Pattern
```python
class CustomerViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    serializer_class = CustomerSerializer
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated, HasTenantAccess]
    filter_backends = [DjangoFilterBackend, SearchFilter]
    filterset_fields = ['status', 'created_at']
    search_fields = ['name', 'email', 'phone']
    
    def get_queryset(self):
        return Customer.objects.filter(tenant_id=self.request.user.tenant_id)
```

### Serializer Pattern
```python
class CustomerSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Customer
        fields = '__all__'
        read_only_fields = ['id', 'created_at', 'updated_at']
    
    def validate(self, data):
        # Custom validation logic
        return data
```

### Permission Pattern
```python
class HasTenantAccess(BasePermission):
    def has_permission(self, request, view):
        return request.user.is_authenticated and hasattr(request.user, 'tenant_id')
    
    def has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj):
        return obj.tenant_id == request.user.tenant_id
```
