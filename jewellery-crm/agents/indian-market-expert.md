### GST Calculation Pattern
```typescript
// GST calculation pattern
class GSTCalculator {
  private gstRates = {
    jewellery: 0.03, // 3% GST for jewellery
    making_charges: 0.18, // 18% GST for making charges
    services: 0.18 // 18% GST for services
  };

  calculateGST(amount: number, category: string, isInterState: boolean = false): GSTCalculation {
    const baseRate = this.gstRates[category] || 0.18;
    const cgst = isInterState ? 0 : (amount * baseRate) / 2;
    const sgst = isInterState ? 0 : (amount * baseRate) / 2;
    const igst = isInterState ? amount * baseRate : 0;
    const totalGST = cgst + sgst + igst;
    const totalAmount = amount + totalGST;

    return {
      baseAmount: amount,
      cgst,
      sgst,
      igst,
      totalGST,
      totalAmount,
      gstRate: baseRate
    };
  }

  validateGSTNumber(gstNumber: string): boolean {
    const gstRegex = /^[0-9]{2}[A-Z]{5}[0-9]{4}[A-Z]{1}[1-9A-Z]{1}Z[0-9A-Z]{1}$/;
    return gstRegex.test(gstNumber);
  }
}
```

### Indian Currency Pattern
```typescript
// Indian currency pattern
class IndianCurrencyFormatter {
  formatCurrency(amount: number): string {
    const formatter = new Intl.NumberFormat('en-IN', {
      style: 'currency',
      currency: 'INR',
      minimumFractionDigits: 2,
      maximumFractionDigits: 2
    });
    
    return formatter.format(amount);
  }

  formatNumber(number: number): string {
    const formatter = new Intl.NumberFormat('en-IN', {
      minimumFractionDigits: 0,
      maximumFractionDigits: 2
    });
    
    return formatter.format(number);
  }

  parseIndianNumber(numberString: string): number {
    // Remove commas and convert to number
    return parseFloat(numberString.replace(/,/g, ''));
  }
}
```

### Festival Tracking Pattern
```typescript
// Festival tracking pattern
class IndianFestivalTracker {
  private festivals = {
    diwali: { name: 'Diwali', date: '2024-11-01', category: 'major' },
    karva_chauth: { name: 'Karva Chauth', date: '2024-10-20', category: 'jewellery' },
    rakhi: { name: 'Raksha Bandhan', date: '2024-08-19', category: 'jewellery' },
    wedding_season: { name: 'Wedding Season', startDate: '2024-11-01', endDate: '2025-06-30', category: 'major' }
  };

  getUpcomingFestivals(days: number = 30): Festival[] {
    const today = new Date();
    const upcoming = [];

    for (const [key, festival] of Object.entries(this.festivals)) {
      const festivalDate = new Date(festival.date || festival.startDate);
      const daysDiff = Math.ceil((festivalDate.getTime() - today.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
      
      if (daysDiff >= 0 && daysDiff <= days) {
        upcoming.push({
          key,
          ...festival,
          daysUntil: daysDiff
        });
      }
    }

    return upcoming.sort((a, b) => a.daysUntil - b.daysUntil);
  }

  isFestivalPeriod(festivalKey: string): boolean {
    const festival = this.festivals[festivalKey];
    if (!festival) return false;

    const today = new Date();
    const startDate = new Date(festival.date || festival.startDate);
    const endDate = festival.endDate ? new Date(festival.endDate) : startDate;

    return today >= startDate && today <= endDate;
