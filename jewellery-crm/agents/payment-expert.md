## COMMON PATTERNS

### Payment Processing Pattern
```typescript
// Payment processing pattern
class PaymentProcessor {
  async processPayment(paymentData: PaymentData): Promise<PaymentResult> {
    try {
      // Validate payment data
      const validatedData = await this.validatePayment(paymentData);
      
      // Process payment through gateway
      const gatewayResponse = await this.gateway.process(validatedData);
      
      // Handle payment result
      if (gatewayResponse.success) {
        await this.handleSuccessfulPayment(gatewayResponse);
        return { success: true, transactionId: gatewayResponse.id };
      } else {
        await this.handleFailedPayment(gatewayResponse);
        return { success: false, error: gatewayResponse.error };
      }
    } catch (error) {
      await this.handlePaymentError(error);
      throw new PaymentError('Payment processing failed', error);
    }
  }
}
```

### UPI Payment Pattern
```typescript
// UPI payment pattern
class UPIPaymentProcessor {
  async processUPIPayment(upiData: UPIPaymentData): Promise<UPIResult> {
    const upiRequest = {
      amount: upiData.amount * 100, // Convert to paise
      currency: 'INR',
      upi_id: upiData.upiId,
      description: upiData.description,
      reference_id: upiData.referenceId,
      gst_amount: this.calculateGST(upiData.amount),
    };

    const response = await this.razorpay.orders.create(upiRequest);
    return this.handleUPIResponse(response);
  }

  private calculateGST(amount: number): number {
    return amount * 0.18; // 18% GST
  }
}
```

### Webhook Processing Pattern
```typescript
// Webhook processing pattern
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  try {
    const body = await req.text();
    const signature = req.headers.get('x-razorpay-signature');
    
    // Verify webhook signature
    const isValid = verifyWebhookSignature(body, signature);
    if (!isValid) {
      return new Response('Invalid signature', { status: 400 });
    }

    const event = JSON.parse(body);
    
    // Handle different webhook events
    switch (event.event) {
      case 'payment.captured':
        await handlePaymentCaptured(event.payload);
        break;
      case 'payment.failed':
        await handlePaymentFailed(event.payload);
        break;
      case 'refund.processed':
        await handleRefundProcessed(event.payload);
        break;
    }

    return new Response('Webhook processed', { status: 200 });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Webhook error:', error);
    return new Response('Webhook error', { status: 500 });
  }
}
```
