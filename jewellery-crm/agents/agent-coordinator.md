## COMMON PATTERNS

### Multi-Agent Coordination Pattern
```typescript
// Multi-agent coordination pattern
interface AgentCoordination {
  analyzeRequirements(requirements: ProjectRequirements): AgentPlan;
  coordinateAgents(plan: AgentPlan): CoordinationResult;
  integrateSolutions(solutions: AgentSolution[]): IntegratedSolution;
  validateQuality(solution: IntegratedSolution): QualityReport;
  optimizePerformance(solution: IntegratedSolution): OptimizedSolution;
}

class AgentCoordinator implements AgentCoordination {
  async analyzeRequirements(requirements: ProjectRequirements): Promise<AgentPlan> {
    const plan = {
      frontend: requirements.needsUI ? '@frontend-expert' : null,
      backend: requirements.needsAPI ? '@django-expert' : null,
      database: requirements.needsDatabase ? '@database-expert' : null,
      api: requirements.needsIntegration ? '@api-expert' : null,
      payment: requirements.needsPayment ? '@payment-expert' : null,
      whatsapp: requirements.needsCommunication ? '@whatsapp-expert' : null,
      ecommerce: requirements.needsEcommerce ? '@ecommerce-expert' : null,
      crm: requirements.needsCRM ? '@crm-expert' : null,
      uiux: requirements.needsDesign ? '@ui-ux-expert' : null,
      security: requirements.needsSecurity ? '@security-expert' : null,
      indian: requirements.needsIndianMarket ? '@indian-market-expert' : null,
      jewellery: requirements.needsJewelleryFeatures ? '@jewellery-expert' : null,
      beginner: requirements.needsEducation ? '@beginner-expert' : null
    };

    return this.createAgentPlan(plan, requirements);
  }

  async coordinateAgents(plan: AgentPlan): Promise<CoordinationResult> {
    const results = [];
    
    for (const agentTask of plan.tasks) {
      const agent = this.getAgent(agentTask.agent);
      const result = await agent.execute(agentTask.requirements);
      results.push(result);
    }

    return this.integrateResults(results);
  }

  async integrateSolutions(solutions: AgentSolution[]): Promise<IntegratedSolution> {
    // Integrate solutions from multiple agents
    const integrated = {
      frontend: this.integrateFrontend(solutions),
      backend: this.integrateBackend(solutions),
      database: this.integrateDatabase(solutions),
      api: this.integrateAPI(solutions),
      security: this.integrateSecurity(solutions),
      features: this.integrateFeatures(solutions)
    };

    return this.validateIntegration(integrated);
  }
}
```

### Project Planning Pattern
```typescript
// Project planning pattern
interface ProjectPlan {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  requirements: ProjectRequirements;
  timeline: Timeline;
  resources: ResourceAllocation;
  risks: RiskAssessment;
  quality: QualityStandards;
}

class ProjectPlanner {
  async createProjectPlan(requirements: ProjectRequirements): Promise<ProjectPlan> {
    const plan = {
      id: this.generateId(),
      name: requirements.name,
      description: requirements.description,
      requirements,
      timeline: this.createTimeline(requirements),
      resources: this.allocateResources(requirements),
      risks: this.assessRisks(requirements),
      quality: this.defineQualityStandards(requirements)
    };

    return this.validatePlan(plan);
  }

  private createTimeline(requirements: ProjectRequirements): Timeline {
    const phases = [
      { name: 'Planning', duration: '1 week', dependencies: [] },
      { name: 'Architecture', duration: '1 week', dependencies: ['Planning'] },
      { name: 'Development', duration: '4 weeks', dependencies: ['Architecture'] },
      { name: 'Integration', duration: '2 weeks', dependencies: ['Development'] },
      { name: 'Testing', duration: '2 weeks', dependencies: ['Integration'] },
      { name: 'Deployment', duration: '1 week', dependencies: ['Testing'] }
    ];

    return {
      phases,
      totalDuration: '11 weeks',
      criticalPath: this.calculateCriticalPath(phases),
      milestones: this.defineMilestones(phases)
    };
  }

  private allocateResources(requirements: ProjectRequirements): ResourceAllocation {
    return {
      agents: this.determineRequiredAgents(requirements),
      priorities: this.setAgentPriorities(requirements),
      collaboration: this.defineCollaborationPatterns(requirements),
      communication: this.setupCommunicationChannels(requirements)
    };
  }
}
```

### Quality Assurance Pattern
```typescript
// Quality assurance pattern
interface QualityAssurance {
  validateSolution(solution: IntegratedSolution): QualityReport;
  checkConsistency(solution: IntegratedSolution): ConsistencyReport;
  verifyPerformance(solution: IntegratedSolution): PerformanceReport;
  assessSecurity(solution: IntegratedSolution): SecurityReport;
  validateUserExperience(solution: IntegratedSolution): UXReport;
}

class QualityAssuranceManager implements QualityAssurance {
  async validateSolution(solution: IntegratedSolution): Promise<QualityReport> {
    const reports = await Promise.all([
      this.checkConsistency(solution),
      this.verifyPerformance(solution),
      this.assessSecurity(solution),
      this.validateUserExperience(solution)
    ]);

    const overallScore = this.calculateOverallScore(reports);
    const issues = this.identifyIssues(reports);
    const recommendations = this.generateRecommendations(issues);

    return {
      overallScore,
      reports,
      issues,
      recommendations,
      status: overallScore >= 0.8 ? 'PASS' : 'NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT'
    };
  }

  private async checkConsistency(solution: IntegratedSolution): Promise<ConsistencyReport> {
    const checks = [
      this.checkDesignConsistency(solution),
      this.checkCodeConsistency(solution),
      this.checkDataConsistency(solution),
      this.checkAPIConsistency(solution)
    ];

    const results = await Promise.all(checks);
    const score = this.calculateConsistencyScore(results);

    return {
      score,
      checks: results,
      issues: this.identifyConsistencyIssues(results),
      recommendations: this.generateConsistencyRecommendations(results)
    };
  }
}
```
